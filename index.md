  <h2>Welcome to Midnight Book Club</h2>

We believe in exploring our curiosity through new experiences & exchanging ideas to break the 9-5 routine. We seek spiritual & intellectual growth through a process of discussion and creation.

Midnightbookclub is a bi-weekly forum at 9pm (Midnight EST). We're a group of young professionals who enjoy analyzing philosophy, science, social justice & current events.
